# CS230-Portfolio
CS230 Module 8 Journal

**Client & Requirements**
The client was The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand its existing mobile game Draw It or Lose It into a cross-platform environment. They wanted a scalable, secure, and flexible design that could support multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS) while centralizing server logic and maintaining data integrity.

**What I Did Well**
I believe I did particularly well in clearly explaining the reasoning behind platform and architecture choices. My recommendations for using Linux for server deployment and RESTful APIs for client-server communication showed a strong balance of technical knowledge and real-world applicability. I also made sure my document was clear enough for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Helpful Parts of the Design Process**
Working through the design document forced me to break down the project into system-level components before writing code. This helped me think through issues like storage, memory, and security ahead of time, which would prevent major rework later. I found this process similar to storyboarding a project seeing the structure in writing helped me visualize the implementation.

**What I Would Revise**
If I could revise one part, I would refine the Distributed Systems and Networks section with more details about scalability testing and specific cloud provider options. Expanding that section with explicit redundancy and failover strategies would strengthen the design.

**Considering the Userâ€™s Needs**
I paid close attention to how users would interact with the system. Since the game needed to work seamlessly across mobile and desktop, I recommended cross-platform development tools (like Flutter or React Native) to minimize inconsistencies. Considering user needs is essential because a technically strong system that frustrates or confuses the end user ultimately fails its purpose.

**My Design Approach**
I approached software design by combining research, analysis, and real-world examples. I considered scalability, cost, and usability equally. In the future, I would use this same structured approach but also incorporate more early-stage prototyping and user feedback loops. This would ensure that the design evolves alongside real user requirements.
